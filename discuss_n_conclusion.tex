\section{Discussion}

Our project is eventually completed successfully. As previously stated, the data transfer rate that is chosen is 1Mbps, and the length of the cable used is around 5 meters. Those requirements have been met  after several iterations of the development and testing processes.



\section{Conclusion}

Based on our project, we believe that the Controller Area Network protocol is well suited for long-distance communication that necessitates the use of a bus system and high data transmission rates. This type of bus system is extremely useful, especially for systems that require long-distance communication without jeopardizing the environment's safety, such as cars and automation robots.
