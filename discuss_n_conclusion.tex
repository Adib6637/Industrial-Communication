\section{Discussion}

Our project was eventually completed successfully. As previously stated, the data transfer rate that we have chosen is 1Mbps, and the length of the cable used is around 5 meters. We successfully met our demand, which is to send data at a high frequency for long-distance communication via a bus system, after several iterations of the development and testing processes.


\section{Conclusion}

Based on our project, we believe that the Controller Area Network protocol is well suited for long-distance communication that necessitates the use of a bus system and high data transmission rates. This type of bus system is extremely useful, especially for systems that require long-distance communication without jeopardizing the environment's safety, such as cars and automation robots.
